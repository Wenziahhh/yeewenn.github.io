         <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Quality education empowers individuals with the knowledge, skills, and values needed to thrive in an ever-changing world. It is the foundation for personal growth, societal development, and sustainable progress.</p>
        <p>Despite its transformative power, education remains inaccessible to millions. According to UNESCO, over 244 million children and youth are still out of school. Barriers such as poverty, gender inequality, and lack of educational resources hinder global efforts to achieve inclusive and equitable learning opportunities.</p>
        <p>Quality education fosters critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving abilities, enabling individuals to contribute meaningfully to their communities and the global economy. It reduces social inequalities, promotes innovation, and lays the groundwork for environmental sustainability and justice.</p>
        <p>By investing in quality education, we strengthen communities, foster inclusivity, and unlock the full potential of future generations. Ensuring access to education for all is essential to building a just, prosperous, and equitable society for everyone.</p>
